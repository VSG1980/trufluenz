My project i did was to recreate teh website i have been working on.
Tried to get it as close as possible but keeping in mind that this is a landing page.
Managed to use code from prevous assignments to put in the footer with social media icons, also took a while but managed to add a hamburger menu on mobile view, had a few issues with changing font size and colour, due to me repeating the class and it was getting ignored. I needed the help of google and youtube videos to figure some of the bits out, and when i really get stuck i ask chat gpt to check code and tell me where im going wrong in a couple of instances. Thanks and Enjoy
